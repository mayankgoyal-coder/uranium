* For this assignment the session branch is session/populate-reference
* For the solution you have to create a new branch in your own repo- assignment/populate-reference2
* Try to use your own mongodb Atlas clusters to avoid sharing of collections and thus errors, please make sure you write the schema correctly. Use these collection names - developers, batches


*  A batch document looks like this.
{
                _id: ObjectId("65321bfa4d9fe0d34da86829"),
name: “Uranium”,
size: 250,
program: “backend”
}
* A developer document should look like this
         { 
_id: ObjectId("61951bfa4d9fe0d34da86829"),
                name:"Sabiha Khan",
                gender:”female”,
                percentage:75,
batch: ObjectId("65321bfa4d9fe0d34da86829")
        }






1. Write an api POST /batches that creates a batch from the details in the request body. Please note that the program should be an enum with the following allowed values only - backend and frontend
2. Write an api POST  /developers that creates a developer from the details in the request body. Please note that the gender should be an enum with the following allowed values - male, female and other. Also, batch attribute is a reference to the batches collection.


3. Write an api GET /scholarship-developers that fetches the list of eligible developers for scholarship. An eligible developer is female with percentage greater than or equal to 70


4. Write an api GET /developers?percentage=value1&program=value2 that only returns the developers for a given program with a percentage greater than or equal to the received value. Please note the batch name and the program values are received in the request as query params.

For example GET /developers?percentage=55&program=radium should return all the developers from radium batch with a percentage greater than or equal to 55
